# About
This project is a predictor of tickets prices of train routes in Spain. The project will provide 3 models based on a linear regression(Unfortunately, I could save only model of a linear regression). The data used to train the model was obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/thegurusteam/spanish-high-speed-rail-system-ticket-pricing). To check accuracy, please get prediction from main.py and compare with prices from https://venta.renfe.com.
